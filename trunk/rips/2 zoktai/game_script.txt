Introduction                                                             [ITDT]
===============================================================================

Once Sun and Moon retreat into darkness, grand twilight descends on the wedge-
binding City of the Sun. A deep shadow is then born in its wake. The beginning
of the end.

===============================================================================
Valley
===============================================================================

Master Otenko: "It's not far now... Pass through this valley and you'll
finally arrive at the City of the Sun, San Miguel. Or rather, the City of Death
that your hometown has been turned into by the Undeadening curse of the Dark
Immortals. I thought that the Undeadening would abate with the Queen defeated.
But I feel it with my solar sense... The Undead still roam there, dark
servants, stripped of life and stripped of death. And the immortal shadow that
manipulates them all... Let's go, Solar Boy Django! Dispel the dark clouds that
shroud the City of the Sun! May the Sun be with you!"

[Try to go south]

Master Otenko: "Hey, Django! San Miguel is north. Head for the top right of the
screen."

[Go north]

Master Otenko: "Huh? Is that a Hint Panel over there? Hint Panels are guides
for adventurers left by those who have gone before. They give you useful info
for your adventure, and tips for overcoming obstacles. To read a panel, move
close to it and press the A Button. It'll do you no harm to find out what it
says."

[A man is blocking the way]

Man in the Hat: ! "..."

Django: ?

Master Otenko: "Careful! He's... Yes, there's no doubt... He's one of the
Immortals! A Vampire!"

All: !

Vampire: "Urgh...?! Urgh... urrrgh!"

<Django points the Gun Del Sol at the Vampire>

Vampire: "The... Sol... ...Solar... gun... The Solar Gun... GUN DEL SOL!"

Django, Otenko: !

<Vampire takes the Gun from Django>

Master Otenko: "He took the Solar Gun?! ...Still, it's no use to him! Only
a Solar Child can operate the Solar Gun! It's useless in the hands of a
Vampire!" !

<Vampire shoots Django>

Master Otenko: "Django! But how...?! Why would a Vampire...?!"

Vampire: "Django...? Uh... uh?!"

Master Otenko: ?

<Vampire screams and then runs off>

Master Otenko: "The danger's passed... for now! But I can't believe it... A
Vampire that can use the Solar Gun! Maybe he is the dark Cloud covering San
Miguel...?"

Django: ...

Master Otenko: "Django... What's done is done. You can't change the past. But
it doesn't mean that the future is decided! What you do right now... That's
what will determine the future! The Sun will rise tomorrow! Remember the blood
and soul that rests in your Crimson Scarf! Something like this would never have
knocked your father's spirits!"

<Django gets up>

Master Otenko: "Let's go, Django! You should find some clues in San Miguel. You
must track down that Vampire and retrieve the Solar Gun! May the Sun be with
you!"

===============================================================================
Unknown Place
===============================================================================

Black Shadow: "So he's surfaced then, the Solar Boy, Django..."

Red-haired Girl: "But he's just a kid... How could he have defeated the Queen,
let alone the Count?"

Black Shadow: "Don't underestimate him! The blood of both the Sun and the Moon
runs in his veins. Anyway, the Queen, -- no, Hel -- simply returned to her
rightful place... Right then! I must get on while there's nothing in the way.
Sleeping Beauty awaits her wake-up kiss. You're in charge of stopping the boy."

Red-haired Girl: "...Okay. What would you like me to do about the vessel?"

Black Shadow: "Let it do as it pleases for now, until its entire soul sinks
into Darkness..."

===============================================================================
City Gate
===============================================================================

Master Otenko: "Behold! The City of the Sun, San Miguel! But now it is truly
the City of Death. ...Huh?! Is that...? Admist the Darkness... I sense a faint
glimmer of life! Could there be something alive in there that escaped the
Undeadening?"

[After opening the treasure chest]

Master Otenko: "Ah, the Gradius... It's a type of sword, I see. It's nothing
compared to the Solar Gun, but it's better than using your bare hands. It can't
purify the Undead without the power of the Sun, but Skeletons are material-type
monsters, with physical form... so you can get rid of them for a while by
destroying their bodies. It's all up to you now, Django!"

[After defeating the Skeleton]

Master Otenko: "Brilliant, Django! Ex Points go up when you defeat monsters.
When they reach a certain point, you'll be able to level up. By allocating the
status points you get when you level up, you can enhance some of your stats.
There are 4 stats you can enhance: Vitality, which affects Life Gauge capacity,
Spirit, which affects you Energy Gauge capacity, Strength, which affects your
attack power, and Agility, which affects your movement speed and your power to
defend. You can allocate your points on the menu screen's status menu. Even if
you level up, your stats won't be enhanced unless you allocate points. So don't
forget to do it!"

[In a room, trapped with a Zombie, a girl appears]

Django, Zombie: !

Magical Girl: "No, no, no! Zombies are undead monsters. Yer can't defeat 'em
without the Sun's power. What where you thinkin', eh?! The Solar Boy losin' the
Solar Gun! Jeez! Gotta use a bit more noggin before yer act. Eh? You cryin'?
Cryin', are yer? Think cryin's gonna help? Even if it's rainin' cats 'n' dogs,
a sunflower holds its head up high! Here! I'll lend yer this. Now, just
cheerup, 'kay?"

*<Alternate text, only if you used a Trigger of Sol password>
*
*Magical Girl: "No, no, no! Zombies are undead monsters. Yer can't defeat 'em
*without the Sun's power. What where you thinkin', eh?! The Solar Boy losin'
*the Solar Gun! Jeez! So you're Trigger of Sol? How embarrassing... Eh? You
*cryin'? Cryin', are yer? Think cryin's gonna help? Even if it's rainin' cats
*'n' dogs, a sunflower holds its head up high! Here! I'll lend yer this. Now,
*just cheerup, 'kay?"

<Django receives the Sol de Vice>

Magical Girl: "That glove's the Sol de Vice. It can add the property of
Enchantment to any weapon by using the Sun's power. It's one
amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing Magic Machine! But for
Enchantment, yer gonna need all different types o' Moonlight Magic. Huh? How
come a Solar Machine needs Moonlight Magic, you ask?"

All: ...

Magical Girl: "It's not that I don't know. I surely do! Don't worry 'bout all
those details. Just use it. Eh? Can't use magic?! You really ain't cut out for
all this! You sure you're the Solar Boy? Surely you can use easy stuff like
ENCHANTMENT SOL, eh? Alright! I'm doing you some bloody favors. Bloody enough
to please them Vampires! Ready?"

<Django learns the Moonlight Magic, ENCHANTMENT SOL.>

Magical Girl: "Listen up, 'kay? To use magic you gotta equip the stuff first on
the menu screen. Then yer equipped magic shows up at the bottom left of the
screen, 'kay? You can switch Enchantment Magic on and off using the L Button.
When yer attack usin' a weapon with Enchantment on, the attack becomes a
property attack, 'kay? Magic lowers yer energy, so watch yerself and don't
forget solar chargin'! Rest is up to you, 'kay?! I'm goin' to the Mall. Don't
be too long, awright?"

Django, Zombie: ...

[After defeating the Zombie]

Master Otenko: "So there's Moonlight Magic in the Sol de Vice...? Well, you'll
be able to purify the Undead with it. You still have much to learn before
facing Immortals, but we can't be picky! But goodness, that girl... and the way
she talks... She said she'd be waiting at the Mall. Go to Sun Avenue, in the
heart of the city. Carry on to the north, Django!"

===============================================================================
6th Avenue
===============================================================================

Master Otenko: "So you've ventured outside... Let me explain, Django. You'll
need sunlight to restore your energy, but if you're exposed to very strong or
are outside for too long, you'll run the risk of overheating both the Sol De
Vice and yourself. If this happens, obviously you won't be able to carry on
with your adventure. So if you see the overheat alert appear over the Solar
Gauge, make sure you get into the shade and rest for a while. Got it?"

===============================================================================
Ruins                                                                    [RUI1]
===============================================================================

Master Otenko: "It's here... Can you feel it? The presence of the Undead...
We're not in the city anymore. This is an Undead Dungeon. Every time you enter
an Undead Dungeon, all traps and enemy monsters return to their original state.
It's all part of the Doomsday Phenomenon. Be sure to stay alert, Django!"

[After the trap room]

Young Man: ! "You're... Django... ...aren't you? I'm Marcello. On the day the
city was attacked by the Undead, I got left behind when everybody ran away..."

Django: ...

Marcello: "I see... Then maybe I'll head for Sun Avenue too. This new warp
magic square will probably take you to the Dungeon entrance. See ya then! You
take care too, okay?!"

===============================================================================
Mall
===============================================================================

[Talk to Master Otenko]

Master Otenko: "So this is what's left of the old City of the Sun...?"

[Talk to Master Otenko again]

Master Otenko: "How about talking to that girl over there first?"

[A blonde girl hides behind Magical Girl]

Magical Girl: "Huh. Made it here didya, squirt? I s'pose you are Solar Boy.
Hey, take care of the rental fee for the Sol de Vice... in the Solar Bank,
'kay? Yeah... 'bout a million should do it. Y'what? Got no cash? Well, that's
just typical, now ain't it... Anyway, I reckon this'll help yer out. You can
borra energy whenever yer want. But watch out, 'cos you'll have to pay it
back, 'kay? Betta use it carefully. Go ask over at Dark Loans if you wanna know
more, awright?"

<Django receives the Dark Card>

Master Otenko: "Aah, that way you speak... it's so familiar... If I'm not
mistaken... Sunflower Girl, isn't it?"

Magical Girl: "And you're Master Otenko, Messenger of the Sun? It's an honor to
meet you. I am the Star Reader, Zazie. Sunflower Girl is the name the old...er,
I mean, the Mistress used in her youth. Not that I can begin to imagine the
old... er, the Mistress at my age. She saved the world with Red Ringo, the
strongest Vampire Hunter. I came here to because of her star reading, to see
the end of the world for myself..."

Master Otenko: "The end of the world... Is that what she predicted?"

Zazie: "That's right..."

The Star Reading: Once Sun and Moon retreat into darkness, grand twilight
descends on the wedge-binding City of the Sun. A deep shadow is then born in
its wake. The beginning of the end.

Master Otenko: "Hmmm... That Vampire... What on earth is going on in this
place? And what could that deep shadow be...?"

Blonde Girl: ...

Zazie: "Oh yeah... You're Solar Boy, so yer should be able to help me out.
Violet's gramps went off looking for somefin' but he ain't come back, see. Now
we can't be lettin' a little kid like this be all upset, right? So how's about
yer go off and bring the old man back, 'kay?"

Master Otenko: "And who is this little girl? Amazing that she's survived
through all the Undeadening in this place."

Zazie: "Probably thanks to the City of Sun's barrier. I dunno though. Violet's
gramps is the one to ask about all that. That old man happens to be steel
Smith, you know!"

Master Otenko: "Smith?! He's still alive?!"

Zazie: "Oh yeah. That's why you've gotta go and save him, awright?"

Master Otenko: "Steel Smith... He used to be an excellent gunsmith. People
called him the Gun Master. He's the man that taught your Father Ringo, the
great Vampire Hunter, about guns. He's sure to have some idea about what's
causing all these strange things here."

Zazie: "Goin' by my star reading', he headed to the cathedral just northwest of
here. 'Course, I'd go there meself, but I'm s'posed to be watchin' the barrier,
see. The barrier that protects this here City of Sun's gettin' weaker, I tell
yer. I dunno how much I can do to help, but I'll be tryin' my best at any
rate."

Violet: "Look..."

Master Otenko: "That's... ...Solar Gun Lens, Flame!!"

Violet: "Me found it a while ago..."

Zazie: "Hey, Django was it? Go on and take it as payment for savin' her gramps.
With that you'll be able to use ENCHANTMENT FLAME, got it?"

<Django retrieves the Solar Gun Lens, Flame, and learns ENCHANTMENT FLAME>

Master Otenko: "If that lens was just lying around... Does that mean he's
close?! But... First thing's first, we'd better find Smith. Come on Django,
let's head for the Cathedral!"

[Talk to Master Otenko]

Master Otenko: "Smith... I really hope he's all right... Django, let's head for
the Cathedral in the northwest!"

[Talk to Master Otenko again]

Master Otenko: "Hmm... It seems like there may be others left here beside Smith
and Violet. I wonder if they've given up hope, or..."

[Talk to Zazie]

Zazie: "I forgot to tell yer... I left some Solar Bamboo on the first floor o'
that Inn. If yer want to recover some Life, yer welcome to use it. Yer use it
by... Oh just give it a beating."

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "Star readin'... It's looking at how the stars move to see the past,
present and future, see. I s'pose yer think it's all a sham, don't yer? Bet
there's plenty I could tell yer about yerself, though..."

<Screen fades>

Zazie: "Ready? You were born in... <your birthplace>. Your rank in the Istrakan
adventure is... <Boktai 1 rank>. Bull's eye, right? I tell ya, my talent scares
me sometimes, y'know."

*<Choose "It is scary">
*
*Zazie: "Oh... And I though you of all people would get it. Looks like I was
*wrong. I spoke outta turn. I'm sorry, awright?"

*<Choose "It's amazing">
*
*Zazie: "Really?! You've made me go all red, sayin' that! Devilish charm, see?
*I'm a wicked girl, I am? Nya ha hah!!"

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "With me standin' guard at the barrier, not even a single spider'll
crawl into the City of Sun! I can't help yer directly with yer battles or
nothing'... but I'll be watchin' yer."

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "Bad luck about the Solar Gun, eh. But don't let it knock yer duck off!
What's done is done, after all. Even if it's raining cats 'n' dogs, a sunflower
holds its head up high! So chin up, eh?"

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "Got plenty of life in yer, right? No? Such a weakling... Just take
this, awright?"

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "Got enough energy, have ya? Gosh, I worry 'bout ya... take this, go on"

[Talk to Violet, without the Warehouse key]

Violet: "... Um... It's in the Warehouse. But there's no key so it won't open.
Marcello of 6th Avenue, Luis of 10th Avenue... Maybe no one's coming back
now..."

[Talk to Violet, with the Warehouse key]

Violet: "Ah... the key! That'll open the door to the Warehouse!"

[Violet enters the Warehouse]

Violet: "Here it is! You can have some, too. Here you go! Chocolate's really
yummy. I'm going to give some to Zazie, too!"

[Talk to Violet after being out in the rain]

Violet: "Ooh, you're all wet! You mustn't be our in the rain, you know. That's
what Grandpa said anyway. ...I know! You can have this!"

<Treasure chest with a Raincoat appears>

Violet: "Now you don't have to worry!"

[Talk to Violet again]

Violet: "Aren't you scared of lightning? I'm so scared, I hate it! I'm sure I
saw something light up in the flash!"

[Talk to Violet again]

Violet: "I wonder if grandpa's okay..."

[Talk to Violet again]

Violet: "How was the chocolate? Nero doesn't think much of it, you know. I'm
Nero's mommy. Nero's so cute and playful!"

[Talk to Marcello]

Marcello: "Django! Thanks to you, I managed to get out of the Dungeon okay! I
heard that you're fighting to save this town, right? That's just amazing!
There's no way I could do it. Don't you ever feel scared?"

[Talk to Marcello]

Marcello: "I really hate fighting... I just can't even stand hurting anyone,
even a monster. That's the way I feel... ...does that sound strange to you?"

[Talk to Marcello again]

Marcello: "I'm quite large, you see... So I'm often misunderstood. But what I
really like is to observe little creatures like birds and fish. Life and death
in their world has a certain cruelty to it too, but I get the feeling that it's
somehow different to the human world..."

[Talk to Marcello again]

Marcello: "Listen up! When you're choosing items to use or weapons and
protectors to equip, press the A Button once over the icon you want on the menu
screen, and then press it again without moving the cursor to use or equip the
selected icon. This is a basic control on the menu screen, so you make sure you
remember it!"

[Talk to Marcello again]

Marcello: "Listen up! To drop items, weapons, or protectors, press the A button
once over the icon on the menu screen and then press SELECT. Once you've thrown
something away, you can't get it back again. Be careful. And remember that you
can't drop equipped weapons or valuables and the like."

[Talk to the Coffin Shopkeeper]

Coffin Shopkeeper: "...Wanna buy a coffin? Trade in your old one first though."

*<Choose "Buy" and buy a coffin>
*
*Coffin Shopkeeper: "Huh. I've never seen a kid more suited for a coffin! ha ha
*ha... If it's coffins you're after, I've got plenty. Come anytime!"

*<Choose "Don't buy" or choose "buy" and don't buy a coffin>
*
*Coffin Shopkeeper: "Such a pity. I've got a coffin that'd suit you like a
*glove..."

*<Choose "Don't buy" or choose "buy" and don't buy a coffin again>
*
*Coffin Shopkeeper: "Oh well... Come back if you change your mind, okay? I'll
*be waiting."

[Talk to the Clocktower Keeper]

Clocktower Keeper: "Hey, young'un... What's a brat like you doing here? This it
the City of Death. Now scram, if you know what's good for you. Hm? Me? I'll be
fine. I'm too old to be moving now. Anyway, I've got work to do. I'm Ennio --
it's my job to keep watch on this clock and make sure time's a-tickin'."

[Talk to Ennio again]

Ennio: "What? The time's off, you say? You dare tell me my clock's wrong?!"

*<Choose "It's not wrong" or "It's wrong" with "Don't fix it">
*
*Ennio: "So you were just having a laugh, were you? Have you never heard the
*saying that time is money? I'm a busy man, you know. I don't have time for
*this kind of messing around. It's hardly likely that my clock would be out of
*sync now, is it? In fact, it hasn't lost any time for ages, not since the
*Great Collapse that destroyed the old world. What did you say? I must be
*really over the hill if I know about all that ancient stuff?! Well! You've
*certainly got some nerve, lad! That's it! Get outta here! I don't want to set
*eyes on you ever again! Honestly! The youth of today just have no manners at
*all!"

*<Choose "It's wrong">
*
*Ennio: "Hmm... Oh well. These things happen. But the people in this town all
*rely on that big clock, you see. I can't change it easily. It can only be
*adjusted once a day, you know. And once the time's changed, you can't undo it
*because the data'll be saved. What do you say then, young'un?"
*
*<Choose "Fix it">
*
*Ennio: "Great, all set! It wasn't easy, mind you. All done then? In that case,
*you should be on your way. Okay?"

[Talk to Ennio after adjusting the time]

Ennio: "No, I tell you! No! The clock's already been adjusted once today,
right? I can only change the clock once a day. Got it? Then you should be on
your way. Okay?"

===============================================================================
The Solar Tree Area
===============================================================================

Master Otenko: "This... is where the Solar Tree used to stand... What a
terrible scar we're left with. The Solar Tree was a shrine to all life in the
world, and it contained the power to use the sun's energy and purify the land.
The Solar Tree was taken away by the City of Death, Istrakan. The Earthly
Maiden, Lita, brought it back to life, and the land there was purified. But
here in San Miguel... There's something preventing that from happening. If we
don't find out what that is, there is no hope for the City of the Sun..."

===============================================================================
Cathedral                                                                [CEDL]
===============================================================================

Master Otenko: "The Cathedral should be through there. I wonder where Smith
could be...?"

[Outside the Cathedral]

Master Otenko: !

<They spot a cat walking into the Cathedral>

Master Otenko: "What was that...?"

[After opening a treasure chest]

Master Otenko: "A Club... That's a hammer-type weapon. It wields a lot of
power, but can leave you open to attack. Be careful. At any rate you can use it
to break wooden boxes that block pathways."

[Inside the Cathedral]

Master Otenko: "From the look of it... we've somehow managed to get inside the
Cathedral."

[Cathedral Great Hall]

Django: !

<After Django and Master Otenko spot the cat going down some stairs>

Master Otenko: ... "That black cat... something's not right... How can we get
access to those steps leading underground? Maybe that treasure box holds the
key?"

[After picking up the Triangle Key]

Master Otenko: "Looks like you've got a key. The blue door is locked. Press the
A Button in front of the door to try the key, but the door won't open if it's
the wrong key."

[After using an Orb]

Master Otenko: "The floor painting in the great hall has appeared... but it
lacks color. Seems like it needs the other three crystals...?"

[After opening a treasure chest]

Master Otenko: "Ah, a Short Spear. One of the spear-type weapons. Since it's
range is long, it's quite ineffective at close quarters. Be careful! At any
rate, you can use it attack things that are one block away. It can probably
used to move those traps in the two eastern rooms as well."

[After going down the secret stairs]

Master Otenko: "I sense something... It's an Immortal! You don't have the Solar
Gun, but you can manage, right, Django?"

[In the boss room, after seeing the cat walk into another room]

Django: !

???: "Wait..."

Django: !

White-coated Woman: "You're the Solar Boy? Well, you're a darling. I am the
White Duneyrr, the Sky-ruling Immortal... Please don't let this shock you,
but... I'm afraid you must die now. My brother told me not to fight you. But
I'm so hungry. I've been asleep for such a long time. Waking up and having a
Solar Child for breakfast is just what I need... So you see, I've really got no
choice. So sorry."

[After you beat Duneyrr]

Master Otenko: "The White Duneyrr... She's an Immortal. You can't afford to
leave her like that. She may be shut away in a coffin for now, but she could
escape. You must purify her with sunlight immediately. But... That Black Cat is
still troubling me... and then there's Smith... Let's first explore a bit
further."

[Cathedral Wedge Room]

Master Otenko, Django: !

Master Otenko: "Smith!"

Smith: "Urgh... urrrrgh..." ! "Is it...? Ah, Otenko!"

Master Otenko: "It's been a long time, Gunsmith!"

Smith: "I'm just a regular blacksmith now. Gettin' a bit too old for it,
though! Anyway, Django! You made it back safely! So you've defeated the Vampire
Lord?!"

Master Otenko: "Oh, yes. And the Queen of Immortals, Hel, as well... But it
came at a price... We lost Django's mother, the Moon Beauty Mani..."

Smith: "I'm sorry..."

Master Otenko: "What about Ringo, Smith?! Is he..."

Smith: "Yup... Dyin' before his master like that... What a useless apprentice!
...Oh, I'm sorry, Django..."

Master Otenko: "...Anyway... What are you still doing here? What on earth
happened here in this city?"

Smith: "Well... Look at this."

Master Otenko: "Is it... a wedge? Some kind of seal?"

Smith: "After the count had gone, it seemed the Undeadening had come to an end.
But then there started to be signs of movement from the Undead, as if they were
seekin' something... Cheyenne, a descendent of the Guards of this city, gave a
warning. He said the Undead were tryin' to break their seal, see. I dunno what
the seal was, but..."

Master Otenko: "The broken wedge... Perhaps it was Duneyrr's seal...? And that
Vampire... There are still things we don't get in this city..."

Black Cat: meow

Master Otenko: "Is that you cat?"

Smith: "That's Nero. A friend o' my granddaughter. He came all this way... For
a cat, he's got some nerve, eh?"

Master Otenko: "Mm... It's thanks to the cat that we managed to get this far.
Thank you, Nero. Anyway, could you go back to Sun Avenue for us, Smith?
Violet's worried, I'm sure. We've got to purify that Immortal."

Smith: "Right you are. I'll be at Sun Avenue then."

Master Otenko: "Come on then, Django! We must take that coffin to the Plaza
north of the Mall. We'll summon the Pile Driver there, and use the Sun's rays
to purify the Immortal White Duneyrr!"

===============================================================================
Plaza                                                                    [WDPU]
===============================================================================

Master Otenko: "All right. This is it. This is where we summon the Pile
Driver!" Taiyoh! "Okay, position the coffin in the center of the Pile Driver!"

Master Otenko: "Now then! You must adjust the 4 Generators with an Enchantment
attack. The Generators are blessed by Father Sun and Mother Earth, so they can
amplify solar energy. This Pile Driver is the one and only way to purify
Immortals!"

[Talk to Master Otenko]

Master Otenko: "Django!! When you're ready, it's time to purify the White
Duneyrr!"

[Enter and re-enter Plaza]

Master Otenko: "Okay, position the coffin in the center of the Pile Driver!"

[In the coffin shop]

Coffin Shopkeeper: "Hey there... looks like you're giving it your all. Huh? Are
you after a new coffin? I'm afraid I can't help you, unless you bring in an old
one. That's the rule. You know... a trade-in system. Come by again when you're
done with the coffin you're using now, okay?"

[Set all four Generators]

Master Otenko: "Everything's set! Ready, Django? You need sunlight to start the
Pile Driver. The sun's out, right?"

*<Choose No>
*
*Master Otenko: "Ah... Guess you won't be able to purify the Immortal. The Pile
*Driver requires sunlight. You'll have to try again when the sun's out. You can
*either look for new dungeons outside of Sun Avenue, or stop you adventure for
*the time being and wait for the sun..."

*<Choose Yes>
*
*Master Otenko: "Great! Make sure sunlight's hitting the solar sensor, then
*press the A Button over the flashing white emblem to start the Pile Driver!"

[Use the Pile Driver with no reading on the sensor]

Master Otenko: "Eh? The sun! You must have sunlight to start the Pile Driver!
Make sure sunlight's hitting the solar sensor!"

[Use the Pile Driver with a reading on the sensor]

Master Otenko: "Taiyooooooooooh!"

[Generators start up]

Master Otenko: "Begin Battle Drive! Now to purify the Immortal with a Solar
Pile from the Generators! The Pile will be more powerful if more sunlight is
hitting the solar sensor. But the Immortal will use Ectoplasm to resist it.
You'll have to push it back into the coffin with Enchantment attacks. Get the
Immortal's Dark Gauge down to zero, and you'll emerge victorious! It's all up
to you now, Solar Boy Django!"

[After the Dark Gauge has been brought down to zero]

White Duneyrr: "Wh-what... At long last... I was released from my deep sleep.
But now... Is this... the end? Brotherrrrrrrrrrrrr!"

[Duneyrr fades away]

Master Otenko: "You have completed the incineration of the Immortal's source,
its Dark Matter. Now there's no way for it to come back. Well done, Solar Boy
Django!"

<They hear a noise>

Master Otenko, Django: ! ...

<They follow the noise>

Ribbon Girl: ! "Master Django! Master Otenko!"

Master Otenko: "Lita! What are you doing here?! The Undead are roaming San
Miguel now, just as Sabata said, and there are signs that the Immortals are
plotting in the shadows behind there. There's nothing you can..."

Lita: "Well, I'm sorry! ...But, I can't just stay out of it, waiting in a safe
place while the two of you are off risking your lives in battle!"

Master Otenko: "But you're a maiden, not a warrior. Surely you wouldn't
purposefully expose yourself to danger?"

Lita: "True, I'm no warrior. I'm a maiden... But as the Earthly Maiden, I
believe there are tasks that only I can fulfill. Besides, San Miguel is my
home. Please, you can't deny me the chance to do what I can to help free this
City of the Sun from Darkness!"

Master Otenko: "...Okay. If you're that determined, there's nothing more I will
say. So, Earthly Maiden Lita... Together we will crush the Immortal's evil
scheme, and restore light once again to the City of the Sun!"

Lita: "Thank you, Master Otenko..."

Master Otenko: "Actually, I wonder if you could help us out now, Lita. The
Undeadening supposedly ceased in this city, but it still can't be purified. Do
you have idea why?"

Lita: "Yes, I do... The land in San Miguel has lost the power of the Sun.
Before the land has a chance to absorb the sunlight pouring down on it...
someone or something is taking that energy away. That something must be
expelled, or else the Solar Tree's seed will not grow, and its power cannot
purify the city."

Master Otenko: "I see... So we know what we must do. First we track down that
Vampire and retrieve the Solar Gun. Then, we get rid of whatever is stealing
power from the land. Right now, we need to gather some clues... Maybe Smith or
Sunflower Girl have come up with something. To the Mall!"

Lita: "Speaking of the Mall, I was wondering if I could be of any use to the
people still left in the city, so I decided to open a Fruit Store! I'm sure the
Solar Fruit I'm selling will help you two on your adventure! Be sure to come
by, Master Django! Keep the Sun always in your heart!"

<Lita runs off>

Master Otenko: "Hm... I'm sure Lita's doing this because she really wants to
help out the city... But maybe she also wants to get close to you..."

*<Choose "Could be a pain">
*
*Master Otenko: "I see... Well, that's the way she is. There's no fault in
*being worried about the future. Now, that great big hole... How did Lita fill
*it in such a short time?"
*
*Master Otenko, Django: ...
*
*Master Otenko: "Don't give up, Django..."

*<Choose "Great!">
*
*Master Otenko: "Right then. In order to make her wish come true, you mustn't
*lose this battle!"

[Talk to Master Otenko]

Master Otenko: "It seems that things have worked out for now... But you can't
let that Vampire have the Solar Gun forever. You must get it back at once!"

[Talk to Master Otenko again]

Master Otenko: "The barrier looks fine. The Legendary Witch, Sunflower Girl,
would be proud of her apprentice!"

[Smith and Violet are standing outside the Solarsmith]

Smith: "Looks like you managed to purify that Immortal then! That's the sun of
the great Vampire Hunter, Red Ringo, for you, eh Django?!"

Violet: "Err... Thanks for helping Nero and Grandpa!"

Smith: "I heard what happened from Sunflower Girl. The Solar Gun, Gun Del Sol,
has been stolen, eh? But that Sol de Vice could be even more powerful if you
use it right, see? You need to get a higher level and make you weapons more
powerful first, though. I run a smithery, you know. With your solar power, I
could make weapons that are even more powerful. That's Solar-forging, see? But,
to make a new weapon, I need two others to work from. Of course, the attributes
of the new weapon depend on the two that you start with. Go collect some
weapons you think would work, and bring them back to the smithery. Right now,
all I can do is smithing... But I'd be happy to help you out!"

<Smith and Violet both exit, Zazie appears>

Zazie: "Yer dun awright, Django! Gettin' back the old man, and takin' care of
an Immortal while yer at it... Not bad. It's all because of that Sol de Vice I
lent yer! (Who'da thought such a load of junk'd be that useful, eh...? Nya ha
hah!) Anyway. 'bout that Vampire's whereabouts... I gotta strong sense of
Darkness from 'round where violet picked up that lens. Them Remains in the
southeast desert, they're a bit fishy. They're up ahead on that path there. Be
careful! It weren't just one thing I sensed, right? There's at least 2
Immortals in them Remains... Aaaah... Well, I'm off for a nap! Lookin' after
this barrier's no piece o' cake, yer know. I'll be at the Inn. Wake me up if
anythin' happens. Now go get 'em!"

[Talk to Smith in the Smithery]

Smith: "There you are. There's some info SOLARSMITH on that panel over there.
Better read it once before we start, eh."

[Talk to Smith]

Smith: "Want to do some forging?"

<Choose "Forge" without reading the explanation panel>

Smith: "Have you read the panel explanation?"

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "Cheyenne's still not back from exploring in the east. Wonder if
something's happened to him...? No, what am I thinking... Cheyenne's a Guard. I
mean, he's the Wind Warrior. He must've just found somethin'."

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "If ya need some forgin' done, just gimme a holler! Any time. I retired
from battle, but I can still do as much as you young'uns!"

[Talk to Violet in the Warehouse]

Violet: "Nero just sleeps all the time. It's no fun!!"

[Talk to Violet again]

Violet: "You shouldn't hold too many items! If your bag's full, you can't carry
any more items."

[Talk to Violet with the Warehouse key]

Violet: "Ah... the key! That'll open up even more of the Warehouse!"

[Talk to Nero]

Nero: "Meooow."

[Talk to Nero again]

Nero: "Meow?"

[In the Fruit Store, talk to Lita]

Lita: "Welcome! Come to buy something?"

[Use the shop]

Lita: "Thank you! Fresh produce like fruit get spoiled if they get too much
sunlight. The expiration date varies for different items, and chips in the
round mark before an item's name represent the condition it's in. Make sure you
check the condition of your items on the menu screen okay?"

[Use the shop]

Lita: "Thank you! You must be really careful in the Dungeons at night. Keep the
Sun always in your heart!"

[Talk to Lita]

Lita: "Have you got enough items, Master Django? If you need more Solar Fruit,
stop by any time!"

[Talk to Lita again]

Lita: "Master Django, are you feeling all right? If you eat rotten food, you'll
get an upset stomach. Take care, okay?"

[Talk to Lita again]

Lita: "Master Django... <3"

Coffin Shopkeeper: "You've come at a great time... I got my hands on a new
coffin for ya! Be sure to take a look! It's got special effects and everything!
I'm sure you'll love it!"

[Talk to Luis in one of the houses]

Luis: "Oh, it's you, sonny! Looks like those monsters can't be gettin' in 'ere
now, eh? That's sure given me a bit of extra time here, I tell ya, sonny. I
can't thank ya enough!"

[Talk to Luis again]

Luis: "D'ya wanna know what I've realized, sonny? 'Fraid I can't tell ya... If
ya don't feel it on your own, ya won't understand. You'll get it soon, sonny.
I'm sure of it..."

[Talk to Luis again]

Luis: "Did ya know this? If you press SELECT on the menu screen during an
explanation of an item, weapon, or protector, ya can fast forward through to
where ya want. Pretty useful, huh?"

[Talk to Master Otenko]

Master Otenko: "We're finally on the Vampire's trail... Django, they say there
are Remains in the desert to the southeast. Head for there!"

[Talk to Master Otenko again]

Master Otenko: "Come to think of it... I'm sure I've seen that Vampire
before... ...But where?"

[Talk to Zazie who is sleeping on a barstool in the Inn]

Zazie: "Huh...? Lemme sleep just a bit more, awright?"

[Talk to Zazie again, she stands up]

Zazie: "What?! No one can disturb my sleep! Take this! The Water Devil's
Allure! Sun Magic, Freeze!"

<Zazie freezes Django>

Master Otenko: ...

<Screen fades>

Zazie: "Sorry. I'm cranky first thing in the morning 'cause of my low blood
pressure."

*<Choose "Huh?!">
*
*Zazie: "Jeez, yer got no guts... Guess I'll have to teach yer that magic I
*used. That'll cheer yer up some. So, yer ready?"

*<Choose "I see">
*
*Zazie: "Knew yer'd understand, Django! That's why you're the one I can count
*on! Right then, I'll show yer that magic I used, awright? Ready?"

<The water blesses Django, he learns the Sun Magic, Freeze.>

Zazie: "Unlike Moonlight Magic, Sun Magic don't use energy. But it needs
sunlight instead, awright? So as long as the Solar Gauge is above the magic
level, yer can use it as much as yer like. Even if the gauge's right at the
bottom, yer can still use a level 0 Freeze. But the amount of time it works for
depends on the level of the gauge, right? So the stronger the Sun is, the
better it works, see. Remember that!"

I run the city's item shop. I was chased out to these Remains by the Undead.
But I stayed cool, man... Only, then I got trapped by that freaky plant. And
then some other dude was about to attack me. It was all bad, man. All bad...
But then, like I said, that dude who looked just like you came by and beat up
on that spikey thing, so I'm gonna get the heck out of here! Anyway, what are
you doing 'round these parts, man?"

*<Choose "I'm lost">

*Kid: "I see... You wanna check out the map on the menu screen. But you won't

*just one per Dungeon. I'm sure I saw one over there somewhere... Anyway,
*man... Who are ya?"
*
*<Screen fades>

*<Choose "I'm after a Vampire" or after choosing "I'm lost">

*been talkin' about?! That stuff he was talkin' about... that's all true?! I
*dig it! I thought that this city was done. But this changes things. I'm
*stayin' put now! I gotta open up shop again. Make sure you stop by, man! My
*shop does protectors too, y'know! Not just items! Oh, yeah! That guy I told
*you about, he got chased off by your look-alike, dude. I dunno where he
*went... But he dropped this. If he were a Vampire... I guess this could be of
*some use, huh?"

careful, man, especially with treasure boxes. I've gotta split now! Watch your
back, dude. Come back alive now!"

Master Otenko: "Dark Boy Sabata! So you're here in San Miguel!"

Sabata: "Django... You really messed up, eh? I mean, you of all people, getting
the Solar Gun Stolen!"

Master Otenko: "How did you know?"

Sabata: "Hmph... 'Cause I took a hit! I'll never forget it, the stunning blow
of the Gun Del Sol!"

Master Otenko: "So you've seen that Vampire? Where is he?!"

Sabata: "He escaped... Or rather, he slipped out of sight... I was caught off
guard. I thought he was a normal Vampire. But what skill... And on top of that,
he had the Solar Gun... thanks to this loser. What exactly is that Vampire?"

Master Otenko: "We don't know... But something gets me. I don't think this is
our first encounter..."

Sabata: "... Well, you clearly can't stand up to him, having lost the Solar Gun

if you want to go after him. Find that first."

[Talk to Sabata]

Sabata: "You think it's strange that I'm here? I'm not like you. I never cared
about the fate of this city. I was raised as a warrior of Darkness by Hel, the
Queen of Immortals... But it's not my deceitful mother I hate. Not anymore.
It's that Dark, who drove both of us to madness, and the Immortals of the
Forces of Darkness who obey his will. I won't let them carry on. That's why I'm
here..."

[Talk to Sabata again]

Sabata: "He's tough... He dodged most of my attacks, and all I could do was get
one lens off him. It'll be virtually impossible to get the Solar Gun back from
him. It might be better just to destroy it..."

[Talk to Sabata again]

Sabata: "Kid from the Item Shop? With the crazy hair...? Yeah, without him
getting in the way, it wouldn't have come to this! What's that? I helped him?
Now why would I do that?!"

[Talk to Sabata again]

Sabata: "Do you know the legend of these Remains? It's said that it's a place
where the dead are resurrected. But they don't lose their past lives' memories
or appearances like the Undead. They come back just as they were before they
died... Does that mean they're Immortals? Or do they have the bodies of men?
But that's just crazy talk. There's no way you can change the past..."

will go down. Your remaining water is shown at the top center of the screen. If
your water runs out, don't push on, Django! Just go back and fill up."

[After entering the hidden desert building]

Master Otenko: "This is a Warp Magic Square... It seems to be connected close
to the Dungeon entrance. You can use it to go in and out of the Dungeon

Magic Square. If you're worried about your equipment, why not return to the
city first and prepare?"

Black Shadow: "Heh, heh, heh... So you've finally figured it out? But it's too
late! Messenger of the Sun, Otenko. This is where you must leave us. I can show

Sabata: "Django! Damn! He's been hit with Vampire blood. The Undeadening is
advancing... The Lunar Child blood should be suppressing the change but it's
not working. Why?! The reaction must be too strong! If it's not stopped, not
only will he turn into a Vampire... he may lose his life. It's a risky gamble,
but... the Pile Driver's the only option!"

Sabata: "At the top right of the screen is Django's Life Gauge. Before that
gets to zero he must be taken to the Pile Driver on Sun Avenue."

who broke out of this seal was the Shadow that took Otenko. Hm. Looks like the
Undead Immortals are the only ones who can transcend death..."

Count away, so the people of the city could escape. We never found his body..."

Blood of the Sun. He was the ultimate Vampire Hunter."

Sabata: "Still, there's no denying Django is in mortal danger of being killed
at his hand... If that man obeys the Immortals, and Dark, I will destroy him.
I'll defeat the Vampire... Even if he was once our Father! I was raised as a
Dark Child... The only life I know to live is one smeared in blood! Haa, haa,

Vampire... And Ringo too. Was the Vampire that you were chasing really
Ringo...?"

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "Come to think of it, I've heard word from Cheyenne. Seems like he's
found something in Dark City to the northeast. Says he going to look into it a
bit further. The Dark City is the ruins from before we were attacked by the
Undeadening... A territory of Darkness made by us mortals. Maybe the Forces of
Darkness coming back to life was our own doing..."

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "Weapons don't go bad in the Sun like fruit and meat do. But if you use
them a lot they can show a bit of wear and tear. Too much damage will
eventually lower the quality of the weapon. It's smart to use it for forging
before that and make yourself a stronger weapon!"

[Talk to Lita]

Lita: "Master Django, I heard that Solar Fruit has no effect on Vampires. I
won't be able to provide you with any blood... But try quenching your thirst
with this!"

Lita: "Thank you! Master Django, even if you become a Vampire, I'll still...
um... Keep the Sun always in your heart!"

[Talk to Lita again]

Lita: "Depriving the earth of its power... That strange plant, the Root of
Darkness, that's sprung up all over San Miguel... I'm sure it's that plant
that's preventing this city from being purified. But the Root of Darkness is
just the tip of it all. Somewhere there is a Darkness Tree, and unless that's
destroyed this town cannot be purified. The Root of Darkness steals the Sun's
energy from the ground, and it seems that this makes it vulnerable to the power
of Darkness. You should be able to use ENCHANTMENT DARK now. You can destroy it
with that!"

[Talk to Lita again]

Lita: "Master Django, are you feeling all right? Solar Fruit doesn't have any
effect on Vampires. Be careful, okay?"

San Miguel. But the Count had a trap in store for us... And we all paid dearly
at the hands of the Vampires. Smith lost an eye, I lost my dear brothers, and
you... You lost your mother, Mani. But despite that, you didn't give up. With
the Crimson Scarf as a memento of your Father, you set off on your travels to
the City of Death, Istrakan... And now, even though you have dark blood

yet!!"

old. But in this period of Darkness... What could the legendary Wedge Seal have
been locking away? It has all been lost in time. Just like people have
forgotten the Sun... And now the powers of Darkness have come back to life. Two
seals are already broken... one at the Cathedral and one at the Remains in the
desert. Go take a look at that."

<Both look at the vines covering the building>

Cheyenne: "That plant... It's definitely not natural. I'm sure it's the
Darkness Tree. By the look of things, the third seal isn't safe either. Looking
at that Root of Darkness that's overwhelming the entire city, it seems likely
that here in Dark City was where it all began. This city is being swallowed up
by the Darkness humans have created themselves. What exactly have we Guards
been protecting all these years...? I can't do anything to put an end to that
Darkness Tree... In fact I don't think there's anything more I can do here...
I'm going to return to the City of the Sun and set up a shop. I'll sell weapons
opposite Smith's place. Maybe that way I'll be able to help you some. And we
must continue to find out more about the Wedge Seal. Django, it's up to you to

[Talk to Cheyenne who is outside the Weapons Shop]

Cheyenne: "Ah, looks like you're fine now, Django. Well, the shop's all ready.
I don't have much stock yet, but Smith and I plan to work together and gather
new weapons as well. Use them to win your battles!"

[Talk to Cheyenne inside the shop]

Cheyenne: "Django, I've got something I want to give you. You should be able to
master it, now that the Sun is back with you."

<Django learns Dash>

Cheyenne: "And I've found out some things about those wedges. The Spiral Tower
that stands on the Hill of Promises to the north if the city... I don't know
what's in there, but the 4-Quarter Seal blocking the path... that used to be
the purpose of the wedges. Four wedges complete the four quarters, sealing away
four Immortals: The Black Dainn, the White Duneyrr, the Red Durathror, and the
Blue Dvalinn... Of the four wedges, three have already been broken. The last
one is in the depths of the Aqueduct in the southwest of the city. Fortunately
a strong Tarot Seal holds the door to the Aqueduct tightly shut. The city's
Guild Master set it up to protect the water supply from the Undeadening. Even
an Immortal would have a lot of trouble breaking through it. Of all the
Immortals that were released, you've already purified two. Just defeat the
Black Dainn who's left, and you will preserve the 4-Quarter Seal. You must find
Dainn, Django!"

[Talk to Cheyenne again]

Cheyenne: "Hi there, Django."

[Use the shop]

Cheyenne: "Hm. The weapons here are just run of the mill. If you want high
quality weapons, try forging them at Smith's place. The quality could go up or
down though, depending on how good you are."

[Use the shop again]

Cheyenne: "Hm. The price you'll get for weapons depends entirely on their
quality. Any with SP will get you a nice tidy sum!"

[Talk to Cheyenne again]

Cheyenne: "Do you remember Lady? Normally she works at the Library, but that's
just a cover... Her real job is running the underground operations in town as
the Guild Master. And she's the Card Master too. You know the seal on the
Aqueduct door that operates by Magic Cards and Tarot? She was supposed to come
back to San Miguel with Smith and me, but I haven't seen her since..."

[Talk to Cheyenne again]

Cheyenne: "There are various ways to get yourself a weapon. The easiest is just
to buy one at this shop, but sometimes monsters drop them as well."

[Talk to Cheyenne again, and choose "Link Shop"]

Cheyenne: "With Link Shopping, you can use the Game Boy AdvanceTM Game LinkTM
cable to buy and sell weapons with your Solar Boy friends. The prices you pay
and charge are entirely up to you. But remember, no matter how strong the
weapon is, if it's higher than your current level, you won't be able to use it.
Got it?"

[Talk to Violet]

Violet: "Poor Nero... Sabata found him for me, but he's hurt... Lita put a
bandage on for me, so he'll be okay. He will, won't he? Sabata's much better
now too..."

<Nero wakes up and walks off>

Violet: "Nero, you've got to rest!"

[Talk to Violet]

Violet: "..."

[Talk to Violet again]

Violet: "Bad Nero!! ...sniff..."

[Talk to Smith]

Smith: "You had me worried there for a while... But I tell ya, I'm sure glad
you're back as Solar Boy again. It's Ringo we've gotta worry about now, eh.
Losing his memory and all when he became a Vampire... But why would the Count
have done that to his arch rival? Maybe it signifies his love and hatred. Or
maybe... Anyway, I'm still worried about what's happened to Otenko as well.
We've toppled the Darkness Tree, but it's still no time to relax..."

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "The power of the Lunar Child blood running through your body is what
brought back Ringo's memory. But that power was abused by the Immortals, and
the Lunar Child disappeared from this world... The last remaining two, Mani and
Hel... Two sides of the moon, Affection and Lunacy, each inherited
separately... Two tragic sisters, split as friend and foe... Mani... please
help guide Ringo!"

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "Weapons have ranks according to their level. Weapons up to level 13 are
C-rank, easy for beginners to use, but not much power. Weapons up to level 29
are B-rank. Special effects come into play at this rank. But giving a weapon a
special effect is all down to your SOLARSMITH, see."

[Talk to Kid]

Kid: "I can't believe you were a Vampire, man... But if your cash is still
comin' my way for items, dude, I'm cool with that. We live in a craaazy world!
We can't worry about all the little details, man. We just gotta chill."

[Talk to Kid again]

Kid: "Hey, dude! Has it ever been Game Over for you? When you get beat in the
middle of an adventure, part with some SOLL and pay to the order of Dark Loans,
and you can continue from the start of the area you were beaten in."

[Use the Item shop]

Lita: "Thank you! Keep your strength up, Master Django! Let's get through
another day!"

[Talk to Lita]

Lita: "I'm so glad you're okay, Master Django... Zazie called us. She told us
to talk to you so the Darkness wouldn't take your soul... Could you hear our
voices?"

[Talk to Lita again]

Lita: "Do you know...? If you're poisoned or confused, you'll get better
naturally in time. Other kinds of abnormal statuses like stomach aches will
heal themselves too. But the Curse of Kaamos never goes away on its own. There
are two ways to lift it. You can either bathe in plenty of sunlight, or use a
Drop of Sun. When the Solar Tree fully matures, you could use morning dew as
well..."

[Talk to the Coffin Shopkeeper]

Coffin Shopkeeper: "You've come at a great time... I got my hand on a new
coffin for ya! Be sure to take a look! It's a Coffin of Darkness. I got it off
the black market. It's a bit hard to handle but if you master it, the results
are spectacular!"

???: ! ! "Who's there?! Hm? A boy? Who are you...?!"

Django: ...

???: "Hmm... Solar Boy fighting the Forces of Darkness, eh...? My name is...
...oh, it's no good! I just can't remember a thing. Seems like I've gone and
lost my memory somehow. What was I doing trapped between these walls in a room
with no exit? How on earth did I manage to get in here in the first place?!"

Django: ...

??? : "You're right... What's the point in hanging around here? I'll go to Sun
Avenue like you said. Hey, there's no need to worry. I have my own skills to
get me through safely. Yeah, my own skills... Not that I can remember what they
are. You take care, too, Solar Boy!"

[After falling in a trapdoor]

???: "Who is it...?!"

Django: !

Ghost Boy: "You did well not to get lost in this time warp. Maybe you could
help... You might be able to find my Pa for me. Please!! Bring my Pa back!!"

*Ghost Boy: "Awww...! I'll give you a reward! Please!! Bring my Pa back!!"
*
*<Forced to choose again>

*<Choose "Okay">

*Ghost Boy: "Thank you!! Pa got taken away by these Ghosts. I don't know where
*they've taken him to, but... He's in the house somewhere. The key we used to
*use for the house is over there. You should take it with you. And remember
*that me, Pa, and the Ghosts are all in the present, okay? Make sure you don't
*get confused between the present and the past."

Ghost Boy: "Pa should be in the house in the present... I wonder if he's
okay...?"

[Talk to Ghost Boy again]

Ghost Boy: "The Ghost will probably try to get in your way. Better be really
careful, all right?"

away..."

Django: ...

???: "Ah! What about my son...?!"

<Screen fades>

Ghost Father: "Django, I really must thank you. I nearly fell in with some evil
spirits back there. I never thought I'd see my son again... But the whole thing
was my fault... It was fair punishment for the things I did when I was alive."

Ghost Boy: "But you did those things to save me... And if the illness has
spread, even more people would've gotten hurt. You didn't do anything wrong,
Pa..."

Ghost Father: "That may be so, but it's not right to sacrifice others, even if
you're doing it to help someone. And in the end, nothing I did saved your
life... I will go to the World of the Dead and accept the judgment of the
Queen. That is the only thing I can do to try to atone for my sins..."

Ghost Boy: "I'm coming with you! I can't let you suffer alone, Pa!"

Ghost Father: "Giorgio..."

Django: !

Ringo: "Django?! So you defeated Durathror... And you got back the power of the
Sun without losing the power of Darkness... ...I'm impressed you found this
place. Dainn is behind here... I was just a step behind, but he got away
through this door. I'm sure that behind here we'll find the Wedge Seal. If it's
broken, yet another Immortal will be brought back to life. We must defeat Dainn
before he can do that. But first we've got to do something about this tarot
Seal..."

Django: ...

Ringo: "No ordinary Immortal could break this seal. But he's the Shadow
Immortal. Apparently he can slip through gaps that are too tiny to see... To
undo the Tarot Seal, we need the cards of the 3 Sages. I can't leave this
place. I need you to go and find the cards, Django! Here, take this! I think it
might come in handy when you're hunting them down."

<Django retrieves the Solar Gun Lens, Earth, learns ENCHANTMENT EARTH>

[Talk to Ringo]

Ringo: "Black Dainn is behind this door. To preserve the Wedge Seal we must
unlock this Tarot Seal... So it's essential we get hold of the 3 Sage cards!"

[Talk to Ringo again]

Ringo: "Listen, Django! I don't know who or what put this seal in place, but
the cards of the 3 Sages must be somewhere here in San Miguel. I'm sure of it.
Otherwise they wouldn't be used as the key. If I only knew how to do some star
reading..."

Lady: "By the way, what are you planning to do with that card? It's very
important because it protects the city's water supply... You know I can't just
let you take it away, even if you are Solar Boy."

Django: ...

Lady: "Getting past the Tarot Seal... No one could manage that, not even an
Immortal... I suppose it's okay. I'll trust you. But just make sure you defeat
that Immortal, okay? It seems that Lita managed to revive the Solar Tree, so
there shouldn't be any problem with the water supply. But I'm a bit worried
about what Cheyenne said. People seem to be gathering on Sun Avenue, so maybe
I'd better return soon, too. There might be some Request Sheets that need to be
taken care of... See you again, then! I'll leave that Immortal to you!"

[Zazie is in the Inn, awake]

Zazie: "The cards of the 3 Sages? I didn't know yer were interested in Tarot
cards! Huh? Yer trying to break the seal? Oh, the Tarot Seal... Didn't know
anyone here could do that kind o' stuff. Out o' the 21 cards, 18 are used for
the Tarot Seal. The other 3 cards are the key for unlockin' the seal. Them 3
cards are the Sages, awright. The Magician, the Hierophant and the Hermit.
Awright, then. Now I'll find out where they are using me star reading'!"

<Screen fades>

Zazie: "The Magician card is... in a holy place, on the opposite side of a
lotus leaf. Guess a holy place's gotta be the Cathedral. And speaking of a
lotus leaf... Maybe that Sun Magic might come in useful, eh?"

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "The Hierophant card is... in a place of thirst, behind a sealed wall.
Guess a place of thirst means them Remains in the desert. And speaking of a
sealed wall... Maybe that Sun Magic might come in useful, eh?"

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "The Hermit card is... in a dark place, inside a house guarded by
special properties. Guess a dark place'd be that Dark City. And speaking of
them properties... Maybe that Enchantment Magic might come in useful, eh?"

[Talk to Zazie after collecting all three cards]

Zazie: "Looks like yer've got all them 3 Sages, eh. See, me star readin's right

???: "Hey, boy!! How's it going'? Huh? Me? My memory's still not comin' back,
but... Hey, what can you do? I'll be fine. I've even set up shop. I'm sellin'
the weapons and items I've picked up for 200 SOLL a peice. I sell 'em in
Blindboxes though, so ya can't see what you're buyin'. To be honest, I've yet
to sell one... So how 'bout it? Ya wanna buy one?"

???: "Level 1 Blindboxes cost 200 SOLL each. Whaddya say?"

<Buy a Blindbox>

???: "Wonder what it'll be?!"

[Talk to ??? after buying a Blindbox]

???: "Boy, don't forget to get yourself a Blindbox before you go, eh?"

[Talk to ??? again]

???: "Listen to this, boy... Some undead monsters, like Ghouls and Mummies, and
some Phantom monsters, like Klorofolun and Ghosts, are weak to the Sun's rays.
This means you can inflict damage on them with rays from Skylights. But you'll
have to be careful in the night when there's no Sun because monsters that
usually lurk indoors go on the prowl outdoors after dark."

[Talk to ??? again]

???: "By the way, boy, have you ever seen one of those monsters colored all
over in red? Those are Crimson Monsters. They've been completely Undeadened.
Dark Matter gets stronger from negative feelings like anger and hatred. The
resentment of defeated monsters awakens these Crimson Monsters. They're a
formidable foe. Don't take them lightly."

[Talk to Lady without having done any Request Sheets]

Lady: "Welcome, young Django! Books can teach you many things. They should help
you on your adventure, so read as many as you like. Oh, also... my Guild work
is really piling up at the moment. Would you mind helping me out a bit? There
are Request Sheets on the left and right shelves. Could you have a go at doing
some of them?"

[Talk to Lady with having done some Request Sheets]

Lady: "Welcome, young Django! Books can teach you many things. They should help
you on your adventure, so read as many as you like. One more thing... It looks
like you helped out on my Guild work while I wasn't around. I was wondering if
I could count on you for more help? I'd be sure to reward you for it."

Lady: "How are things?"

["Discuss work" with Lady]

Lady: "Weren't there any requests that you fancied? If you change your mind,
have a go any time!"

["Chat" with Lady]

Lady: "Hmm, actually... wasn't your house behind 6th Avenue, Django? That area
was completely ransacked, wasn't it..."

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "You get Ex Points by defeating enemy monsters. But if they're killed by
a Skylight or a Dungeon trap, or by another monster, you won't get any points.
Better remember that!"

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "You know... there are monsters roaming about in the Forest at the end of
10th Avenue. It used to be such a peaceful forest, but now it's full of the
Dead..."

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "Apparently... the Catacomb under 10th Avenue has been contaminated by
the Undeadening. I hope all those monsters don't start surfacing above
ground..."

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "Did you know... the big mansion at the end of 2nd Avenue is like Dark
City, just an uninhabited ruin. But now somehow monsters have intruded. I
wonder what's in there...?"

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "Actually... have you taken a look at the Treasury on 8th Avenue? It's
been made into a kind of puzzle. If you like that kind of thing, why don't you
have a go? It's quite tricky!"

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "I was thinking... don't the iron bars on 12th Avenue bother you? What on
earth could be behind them...?"

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "I've been wondering... when do you think the mystery door on 6th Avenue
will open?"

[Talk to Lady and choose "Gift"]

Lady: "A gift exchange is when you swap the Battle Points you collect in link
battles for Magic Cards. But which card you get depends on your fate... And if
you bag is full, you won't be able to make the exchange, so watch out! Have a
go, and see if you can get some good cards!"

[Before taking on a request]

Lady: "Well, good luck then, Django! <music note>"

[If you fail a request]

yourself too hard, okay?!"

illusion... People just play the part of the person that suits them at the
time, wagging their tails at those they like, and shaking their heads at those
they don't. Just like switching between the Sun and Darkness... Isn't that so,

I'm not part of some group! And I don't take orders from anyone! Even from the
Galaxy Universe, Dark!!"

Black Dainn: "I will see to it that Dark's will is obeyed... Neither of your
inherited bloodlines are any use! You inadequate Dark One! I have no use for
you anymore!"

Sabata: "Inadequate...? What's wrong with that...? I used to seek completeness.
Complete power... But it's because people aren't complete that they keep
striving for more! Being able to wish for things... the power to dream... Being
incomplete gives them potential for the future! They have hope! You don't even
have a self! You could never understand."

Black Dainn: "Believe me, there is no hope for you... What will come out of
betraying the Will of the Galaxy Universe? Do you think you stand a chance?"

all life. Of course... Right from the start, I don't stand a chance. All the
starts, all life... Everything is enveloped with eternal death. People die...
But me... I don't care about all that. It's all about how I live. Resisting and
fighting to the end. That's what it means to me... to live!"

Black Dainn: "Then you will die fighting... Django, I still have many things I
want to talk to you about. But now is not the time. ...The fourth one is awake.

Zazie: "Yer know... there's more about the old hag's star readin' I was tellin'
yer about."

The Star Reading: Once Sun and Moon retreat into darkness, grand twilight
descends on the wedge-binding City of the Sun. A deep shadow is then born in
its wake. The beginning of the end. The shadow plunges the infant sun into
darkness, depriving the new moon of its shimmering light. And so awakens the
Doomsday Beast. The world of the living, amidst chaos, shall sink into the
world of the dead.

Zazie: "Sun and Moon, right, I reckon that might be Ringo and Mani, eh... And a
deep shadow... That could be that Black Dainn who captured Ringo. The two of
'em passed away, and Dainn came back... And that bit about the infant Sun being
plunged into Darkness... If that signifies you, when you became a Vampire, then
half of it's like the star readin' said. But that don't mean everythin' is! The
path to the tower's open now, but the Doomsday Beast's not awake yet! It's not
too late for Ringo... There's still time! Whatever happens, yer've gotta stop
Dainn, Django!"

traveling the right path all this time...? What is there that I can do right
now...?"

[Talk to Cheyenne again]

Cheyenne: "Enemy monsters all have different properties. Of course, an
Enchanted attack with that monster's property won't do much, but if you Enchant
an attack with the opposite property, an enemy weakpoint property, you can
deliver several times more damage than usual."

[Talk to Violet]

Violet: "Nero... He'll be okay, right?"

*<Choose "Probably not">
*
*Violet: "Sniff... ...Nero..."

*<Choose "Yes">

*Violet: "Hmm... ...Nero... Nero belongs with me. And I became like his mum...
*But I haven't been such a good mum..."

[Talk to Smith]

Smith: "So Ringo... has been reduced to a Vampire, and had his body stolen from
him. Has his soul already sunk into Darkness...? What am I talkin' about?! I
should know how stubborn that guy is! He's not the type to fold under somethin'
like this! Django... you've gotta help Ringo. Save his soul!"

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "The Sun will rise tomorrow! That was Ringo's catchphrase... Django!
Believe in Ringo! Believe in your Father!"

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "Weapons have ranks according to their level. Weapons up to level 45 are
A-rank, not even sold at the Weapon Shop. They're designed for pros! The only
way you can get them is by Solar-forging."

[Talk to Kid]

Kid: "The recovery items I've got at my store, man... They're not as effective
as fruit or meat, but they don't go bad in sunlight. Dude, you'd better get
some of them just in case, eh?"

[Talk to Kid again]

Kid: "Chocolate doesn't go bad, but it's no good in heat. That stuff's gonna
melt if it gets too much Sun, man. Still, melted chocolate tastes good too,
right?"

[Talk to Lita]

Lita: "Master Django... I can't believe Ringo's body has been taken over by an
Immortal... But Ringo's your Father, Master Django! Even if they take his body,
I'm sure his heart won't be defeated by the Darkness! And also Master Otenko...
You believe they're okay, don't you, Master Django?!"

*<Choose: "I'm not sure">
*
*Lita: "Master Django...! Brighten up your spirits! Keep the Sun always in your
*heart!"

*<Choose "Yes">
*
*Lita: "That's the Master Django I know! Keep the Sun always in your heart!"

[Talk to Lita again]

Lita: "Master Django, have you noticed a crystal-like thing appear out of the
floor when you're fighting? That's a Solar Bamboo Shoot. They're clumps of
energy that's stored in the ground. All kinds of Spirit Bugs are hidden in
Solar Bamboo Shoots. There are Solar Bugs that store solar energy, Darkness
Bugs that store Dark Matter, and Moon Bugs that can restore your life energy.
Spirit Bugs of the same property as yourself can restore your energy, but ones
of the opposite nature can suck energy away, so careful of that!"

[Talk to Lita]

Lita: "Solar Fruit grows in the sunlight. If there's a good dose of sunlight
one day, the following day will bring a big harvest of fruit, so I'll be able
to give you a discount. Up to 40% off! Keep the Sun always in your heart!
That's the spirit!"

Sabata: "Looks like you managed to deal with the Immortal. He is in the
tower... This Spiral Tower's made of two towers, the Solar Tower and the Dark
Tower. There are two security locks in the two towers. And there are two keys
for the locks: the power of the sun and the power of darkness. The solar energy
from the sun's rays, and the Dark Matter from the Darkness. Without either of
them, you can't get to the top of the tower. That's why Dainn was after your
body and your father's as well. Not mine. I've already lost the power of the
sun... What on earth could be so important that it'd bring a Solar Child and a
Dark Child together to protect it, when they'd normally be enemies? Whatever it
is, we can't just let that Immortal do anything he wants with it! Django, let's
go after him! Up the tower!"

[Talk to Sabata]

Sabata: "You ready?"

*<Choose "Not yet">
*
*Sabata: "Time's running out! Get ready quickly!"

*<Choose "yeah" to go and open the doors>
*
*Sabata: "Right! First I'll use Dark Charge and open the dark door. Once that's
*open, you follow with Solar Charge and open the solar door quickly. Okay?!
*Let's do it!"

[If you fail to Dark Charge]

Sabata: "There's no time! For Dark Charge, hide the solar sensor from sunlight
and hold down on the A Button!"

[If you fail to Solar Charge]

Sabata: "What are you doing?! For Solar Charge, expose the solar sensor to
sunlight and hold down on the A Button!"

[Once the doors are open]

Sabata: "Ready, Django? If we don't conquer both the Solar and the Dark parts
of this tower at the same time, we can't get to the very top. I'll take the
Dark Tower. Your job's to conquer the Solar Tower. Don't let me down!"

[Try to enter the Dark Tower]

[If Sabata reaches the top first]

Sabata: "This is the top... but... ...it looks like a dead end! Ah, no... There
are two weight switches! Guess I've got to wait for Django, then."

[After Sabata and Django press the switches]

Sabata: "Django, Dainn is probably waiting beyond here. This time we've got to
settle things. But first I need to tell you something. Dainn's taken over
Father's body, but what happened to his soul...? Maybe it's already sunk into
Darkness? Or maybe it's still struggling internally? Either way, Dainn's not
the kind of enemy you can afford to go easy on. Got it? We're going all-out! No
holding back! Don't be confused and think you can help Father out!"

Django: ...

Sabata: "Let's do it!"

[In the Immortal room]

Black Dainn: "So it seems Dvalinn could only slow you down... Still, she
fulfilled her duty well enough. As we speak, the binding spear is about to be
drawn out."

<The tower shakes>

Black Dainn: "Heh, heh, heh... Now my destiny as the true Dark Child is
fulfilled! Ha, ha, ha...!!"

Sabata: "You... What have you done?!"

Black Dainn: "So you really don't know? It seems I was right to seal away
Otenko. San Miguel, the City of the Sun, is no ordinary city. Underneath it
lies the ancient Sol City... One of the heavenly cities created by the late Sun
Kindred, the Solar Children, fell to the ground. Of course, there was a reason
for that."

Sabata: "The seal..."

Black Dainn: "Very perceptive! Yes, Sol City was brought down to the ground in
order to seal something away... This something was the Doomsday Beast...
Jormungandr! The Ancestor Piece even Immortals fear..."

Sabata: "Ancestor Piece?"

Black Dainn: "When the Count attacked this city... it was all part of my plan.
He was sent to spy on Hel, but then fell in love with her. We didn't expect him
to break away from us. Someone like Hel becoming Queen... what a bad joke!"

Sabata: ... "You said the binding spear? You mean this tower is..."

Black Dainn: "Exactly! A giant spear guarded by the four wedges and three
bloodlines. The tower is the seal that bind Jormungandr in place. That's what
this Spiral Tower is! Heh, heh, heh..."

Sabata: "Hrmph! If this tower's a binding spear, then we can just thrust it
back in again! It hasn't been withdrawn all the way yet!"

Black Dainn: "True, it's not too late. Django, I'll ask you once... Join us!
Become our Dark Sun! The world is in the midst of its Doomsday Reincarnation,
the recurring cycle of life and death. The unforgiven... hurting others,
hurting themselves, hurting the whole world... That pain hurts the stars, the
solar system, and the very Galaxy Universe itself. Someone has to stop it. Only
the Immortals of the Forces of Darkness can do that... If people reject the
eternity of becoming the Undead, they must be sent back to their ancestral
origin with or without the dawn of Doomsday... Surely you must understand?
Django! Together, let us free this world from the hands of the unforgiven!"

[Halfway through the battle, Dainn leaves Ringo's body]

Black Dainn: "Tsch!... What a bothersome body! It's no use to me anymore!
...Behold! The power of the true Dark Child! The power of my shadow that even
casts all stars into darkness!"

[After you defeat Black Dainn, he goes back into Ringo's body]

Black Dainn: "I... But I am the true Dark Child... How can this be?"

Sabata: "You still don't know? You're just like me... Just a piece of nothing
being used by Dark!"

Black Dainn: "No... Can't be... Ringo's soul... It should have sunk completely
into Darkness... But..."

Django: "The Sun will rise tomorrow... Even if the Sun sets... it always rises
again!"

[After Dainn is sealed into the coffin]

Sabata: "So the tower, the binding spear, is back to normal. But... what about
the Doomsday Beast? We've got to make sure. Django, you purify this guy. And...

Black Dainn: "Urrrgh... Ringo...! You're trying to leave me...?! You'd throw
away your future?!"

Ringo: "I'm not throwing it away... I'm passing it on! I'm already dead. But
even so, my blood and soul will live on in my sons! That's what it means... to
live!"

Ringo: "Yes, exactly! Even if my body were to disappear... the Sun will rise
tomorrow! People grow and evolve. That's by no means the path to extinction!
Live, Django! Otenko... look after my sons!"

<Zazie runs into the Plaza>

Zazie: "Django, that was... ...Ringo..."

Django: ...

Zazie: "The Ancestor Piece, Jormungandr... So that was the true form of the
Doomsday Beast... It's called an ancestor 'cause it's the mother of all
existence. The seeds of all kinds o' being come from that one seed, y'see. The
seeds grow, bear children, and go on evolving, while transcending all time and
age. That's the reincarnation cycle of life and death. But them Immortals are
like seeds of anti-being, puttin' a stop to life and death... The Forces of
Darkness, playin' out eternity in a vacuum of time. But the Ancestor Piece
ain't a seed o' being or a seed o' anti-being. It can't be granted life or
death. It just exists. Eternity... The absolute existence even the Immortals
fear. Yer can't kill somethin' that can never die. That's why it's sealed away.
It really is a Doomsday Beast, eh? If that kinda creature woke up, it'd really
be the end o' the world for sure. To think that was the Will of the Galaxy
Universe..."

<The ground shakes>

Zazie, Django: !

Zazie: "Is this... Jormungandr?! If it is...? Oh no! If only Master Otenko were
here for times like this!"

Nero: meow

Zazie: "Wait... Can't be!?"

???: "Yes, that black cat is Otenko."

Zazie, Django: !

<Sabata appears>

Sabata: "Dainn's old body, and now the vessel that holds Otenko's soul. --
That's Nero."

<The ground shakes again>

Sabata: "The Doomsday Beast may soon awaken. At the moment, his body is
ensnared by the Spiral Tower... but that'll change once Jormungandr wakes up...
And we can't get to him because the door that leads underground is still
sealed. It's protected by a third power following the Sun and Darkness..."

Zazie: "The power of the Moon, the power of the Lunar Child, right?"

Sabata: "Exactly. I don't have that power in me now... But I do know how to
summon Otenko's soul sealed inside Nero. I once sealed Otenko into my own very
soul, so I know. Now that Nero's recovered his strength, he should be up to the
separation... Here it goes!"

Master Otenko: "Ah! At last... I'm back to my true form...! Thank you, Sabata!"

Sabata: "Hrmph! I didn't do it for you. Just didn't want to lose the battle
without even putting up a fight."

Master Otenko: "Hm. I see I don't need to ask whether you're okay, with that
kind of comment!"

Zazie: "Master Otenko, What about Jormungandr's seal?!"

Master Otenko: "It's okay. I understand the situation. Although I was sealed
away, I could still share consciousness with Nero."

Sabata: "So, you know what to do?"

Master Otenko: "The method is simple. Strike Jormungandr's head, deep below the
Spiral Tower, and reposition the seal at the same time."

Sabata: "But the door leading underground!!"

Master Otenko: "Sabata, that problem has already been solved."

Sabata, Zazie, Django: ?

<The screen fades>

Master Otenko: "...So, even though he'd become a Vampire, he chose to meet his
end as a human. Hm... He was definitely one that defied death. Farewell, Ringo!
The ultimate Vampire Hunter! My greatest friend! Your blood and soul... lives
on in your sons...!"

<The ground shakes>

Master Otenko: "Django... Come to the Spiral Tower as soon as you're ready.
This isn't a battle just for San Miguel. The fate of the entire world rests on
it. Make sure that you don't have any regrets, all right? May the Sun be with
you!"

[Talk to Zazie]

Zazie: "What's up, Django? Getiin' cold feet? Of course yer nervous... Yer
facin' the Doomsday Beast! But yer not alone, awright! Yer got me and old Smith
o' course, and all these folk who've gathered in Sun Avenue to cheer yer on,
too. Everyone's gonna give their support for sealin' away that Jormungandr. All
'cause of what yer've done up to now. Yer've touched everyone's hearts. Yer can
do it! Everyone believes in yer!"

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "As it turns out, all this is just like what the old hag's star readin'
said... But it can't just end like this. If it did, there'd be no point in the
old hag bringin' me to this city. I reckon I'm here to change the future.
That's right, ain't it, Django?!"

[Talk to Zazie again]

Zazie: "Eh, Django... Who's Carmilla? ...Oh, no! I should never have brought it
up! It's a bad habit of star readin', wanting to know about other people's
pasts. Still... I'm sure I've heard that name Carmilla before. Yeah, the Cryin'
Witch. She was feared and killed for her amazin' power. Magical powers... It's
not like she even wanted to have 'em..."

[Talk to Lady]

Lady: "Jormungandr, the Doomsday Beast... We can't afford to let something like
that awaken again. Now listen, Django. I know I've told you before, but... I
believe in you. And so does everyone else in this city. So... believe in us
too, and strike Jormungandr right on the head, okay? Don't worry. I know you
can do it!"

["Chat" with Lady]

Lady: "Are you using Magic cards? Magic cards and Tarot cards all harbor great
strength. If you use them right, you can turn a tough jam into an opportunity,
you know. But get it wrong, and an opportunity might become a tough jam. Take
care!"

["Chat" with Lady again]

Lady: "Do you know about Skill? Skill is a barometer that measures how much you
have mastered a weapon. By SOLARSMITH a weapon, or by using it to defeat enemy
monsters, your Skill for that weapon-type will increase. The quality of the
weapons you make by forging goes up with your Skill. And with gun-type weapons
or your bare hands, the attack power increases with Skill. You can check your
Skill level on the status menu on the menu screen."

[Talk to Cheyenne]

Cheyenne: "...The Wedge Seal has been broken, and the bond of the Spiral Tower
is no more. Yet the Doomsday Beast... might still awaken. I couldn't fulfill my
duty as a Guard... ...But even so, there's still hope. And that hope is you!
There is no good to be gained from regretting the past. We must think what we
can do now so that we can have hope for the future! There is still something we
must fulfill! Right, Django?! We're going to make sure that Jormungandr is
sealed away again!"

[Talk to Cheyenne again]

Cheyenne: "By attacking an enemy monster from behind, you can increase the
damage you inflict. But it's not as powerful as an attack that's Enchanted with
the monster's weakpoint property. Yes... weakpoint property and back attacks...
I guess a combination of the two is the ultimate battle technique."

[Talk to Cheyenne again]

Cheyenne: "To find out a monster's weakpoint property, watch how it reacts hen
it suffers an Enchanted attack... If attacked by its weakpoint property, black
smoke will come out of its body."

[Talk to ???]

???: "Yes, the Doomsday Beast... So it seems the fate of the world has been
placed in your hands, Solar Boy... You can't afford to lose, boy!"

[Talk to ??? again]

???: "This is the last battle. Prepare your weapons and protectors carefully.
Don't forget about items either. You must think long and hard about what you'll
need. If you find you're short of items, just pull out of the fight. Don't
hesitate. As long as you're alive, you'll always have another shot at it."

[Sabata has brought Nero back to Violet -- only if you don't go to the Undead
Zone first]

Sabata: "...It's nothing to worry about. A bit of rest and he'll be fine
again."

Violet: "Okay..."

<Django enters the Warehouse>

Violet: "Ah, there you are! Sabata's just helped Nero again!"

Sabata: "Funny huh, Django? Gosh, I can't believe I'm helping out other people.
Maybe Carmilla's preaching has affected me... ...But there's nothing wrong with
that! Violet, I've got my own battles to fight now. I can't help Nero anymore."

Violet: "..."

Sabata: "But even if I'm not around, you can still help him. Right?"

Violet: "...I guess... I'll... Yes! I'll be the one to look after Nero now!"

Sabata: "That's right. That's your battle! Don't you give in, Violet!"

Violet: "Yeah! I'll do my best! And you do your best too, Sabata!"

Sabata: "Hrmph! That always goes without saying..."

<Sabata leaves>

[Talk to Violet]

Violet: "Don't worry, Nero... I won't let anything happen to you from now on!"

[Talk to Violet having found all Warehouse keys]

Violet: "There are 3 Warehouse keys in all. Now you've found all of them!"

[Talk to Smith]

Smith: "You can leave the sealing up to us. We can't let Ringo steal all the
glory! It'll be the first big job we've had in a while, and we're up for it!
You go and give that Jormungandr the good whack on the head he needs!"

[Talk to Smith with the Solar Gun back in your possession]

Smith: "Huh? That thing you hold... Is that... the Solar Gun, Gun Del Sol!! So
you finally managed to get it back, eh? It's not in good shape though. It's not
gonna be much use like that. Let's see if I can fix it for you. They used to
call me the Gun Master, see. Probably won't be as good as it was to start with,
but I'll get it going again!"

<Smith fixes the gun>

Smith: "That should do it!"

<Django receives the fixed Gun Del Sol>

Smith: "It should be usable now, but you can't change lenses, I'm afraid. And
the energy efficiency's dropped a bit. I have tried to make up for it though.
By holding down on the B Button, you can amplify its power and shoot a high-
energy charge. Give it a try."

[Talk to Smith again]

Smith: "Ringo... How could he pass on from the world and leave me behind, just
an old man... What a stupid fool!"

[Talk to Smith]

Smith: "When you're Solar-forgin', the same combination of materials usually
leads to the same type of weapon. But on top of that, depending on your luck
and skill, you can make rare weapons. They're R-ranked weapons, see. Have you
already got one, Django?"

[Talk to Kid]

Kid: "I heard what happened, man. Seems like you've got some serious stuff
going on... I'm just a shopkeeper here at the item shop. It's not like I own
it, dude. There's not much I can do to help ya, my man... But I know what
you're up against. Even I can see how tough it's gonna be. So I was thinking...
Maybe I could lend you a hand? Items are the way! We've gotta keep at it!
That's what it's all about, man!"

[Talk to Kid again]

Kid: "Did you know? When chocolate melts, the item in the row below it gets
chocolate-covered. But it'll go back to normal after you've used it once, man.
So by getting the chocolate to melt, you can hold two items in one space, dude.
Only thing is, you can't see what a chocolate-covered item is underneath until
you've used it once, and the chocolate goes away. Guess it's not something for
beginners, right dude?"

[Talk to Kid again]

Kid: "You can reduce damage if you equip a protector, but if you try and carry
one that's too heavy it'll really slow ya down, man. You gotta pick a protector
that's right for your Agility, okay?"

[Talk to Lita]

Lita: "Master Django! Please let me help you in sealing Jormungandr away! I
can't ignore Ringo's dying wish! It's been a while, but... I'm ready to get
serious now!"

Django: (Lita getting serious... ...let me not imagine it.)

[Use the item shop]

Lita: "Thank you! Make sure you're well-prepared before setting off, Master
Django."

[Talk to Lita]

Lita: "Do you know about fighting without weapons? When you're not equipped
with a weapon and you attack, you'll strike with your bare hands. You can only
make short-range attacks with your bare hands, and you can't use Enchantment
either. Still, bare hand attacks don't leave you unguarded for enemy attacks.
Since both Strength and Skill have a direct impact on the attack power, the
more you train, the more powerful the attacks become. ...Master Django... How
about we both try for maximum power together?"

[Talk to Lita again]

Lita: "The Solar Tree is just like Solar Fruit. It needs the sun's rays to
grow. If you, Solar Boy, are at one with the sun, Master Django, I should think
it won't be too long before the Solar Tree is fully grown."

[Talk to Marcello]

Marcello: "The new Solar Tree has taken root, and the animals have finally
returned to this place... But is it over... ...this time around?"

[Talk to Marcello again]

Marcello: "Jormungandr, the Doomsday Beast... The Undead and the Immortals are
the ones that threaten the cycle of life and death, but Jormungandr also has
the power to influence the life of the stars. It's hard to believe there's
something so powerful lying dormant in this town... Can the stars not escape
the cycle of life and death yet again...?"

Luis: "What is this earthquake? My life... You saved me, sonny, but... ...is it

The moon reflects the light of the Sun. But she's more than just a mirror. Her
light bears the affection and lunacy of all things, and directs every power in
existence: the Sun and the Darkness, and the four elements of fire, water, wind

time ago, you sealed me away, along with the Spirits of the Ancients, Muspell
and Garmr. That was the moon's dark side, the power of lunacy. But now you have
rescued me from a prison of shadows. Your power even saved the small life that
was turned into a prison. That was the moon's Sun side, the power of affection!
Your actions of helping others will lead you on the path to becoming a Moon

your child, Sabata, the Moon Beauty!"

<The door opens and Sabata falls to his knees>

Master Otenko: "Are you okay, Sabata?!"

Sabata: "The Doomsday Beast... Incredible... Just holding the reins on this one
is too much pressure...! Django, it's up to you now to strike Jormungandr. It
doesn't look like I can leave here any time soon. This is my battle... You have
your own battle awaiting you! Now go forth! Solar Boy Django!"

Master Otenko: "you hold the fort here, Sabata!! Jormungandr's head... We'll be
sure to strike it!"

<Django and Master Otenko enter the Undead Zone>

[Go back and talk to Sabata]

Sabata: "I don't believe it... Me... A Moon Beauty... This is like my worst
nightmare. Surely I shouldn't have affection in me? But if I do then it must be
from Carmilla... Her soul that lies within me alongside the Dark Matter. It's
her soul that's turning me into a Moon Beauty... The Crying Witch I killed,
Carmilla... If only... I wish I could give back human life and death to her.
...An impossible dream. And yet, I..."

[Talk to Sabata again]

Sabata: "We lost our mother, defeated our father... And yet... We must go on.
There's no victory in our fight. Which is all the more reason that we mustn't
lose. Keep up the good fight... That's the only sure way to resist the evil
plots of Dark!! Right, Django?"

[Talk to Sabata again]

Sabata: "Django, while you're underground, the Sunflower Girl and all will
prepare for the sealing. You should just concentrate all your efforts on
hitting Jormungandr's head, okay?"

Master Otenko: "Are you ready?"

*Master Otenko: "The Will of the Galaxy Universe, Dark... This doesn't just
*stop at the Undeadening of all life forms... It also plans to take back all
*species to nil with the Ancestor Piece. If we don't do something, this whole
*star is going to get swallowed up. That's how much it wishes to stop the
*evolution of species... of the Solar System..."

[Go down a floor]

Master Otenko: "What is that I feel...? Is it the Undead? This is the deepest
floor of the Spiral Tower, already within the seal. Nothing usually exists in
this space... But there's this landform... the Ancestor Piece, Jormungandr.
Could its existence be the whole cause of all these Undead phenomena...? You
can't afford to be reckless, Django! May the Sun be with you!"

[When you reach the bottom floor]

Master Otenko: "This is the very bottom... So much disease in the air. The
Undead influence has spread fast... If something is not done... The Spiral
Tower won't stay a binding spear for much longer! Let's hurry, Django! But be
careful! This diseased air... From here on out, you won't be able to retreat or
save! You'd better save right now, okay?"

[Before facing Jormungandr]

Master Otenko: "This is it... The tip of the tower. Jormungandr's head will be
up ahead... You can't defeat Jormungandr, the Eternal Ancestor Peice. But if
you inflict enough damage on its head to make it unconscious, you just might
have enough of a window to seal it away again! Everything rests on this battle!
Go for it, Solar Boy Django! May the Sun be with you!"

[Face to face with Jormungandr]

Master Otenko, Django: !

Master Otenko: "This is the Ancestor Piece, Jormungandr! Maybe the Ancestor
Piece possesses no reason... Maybe all there is to it is a greedy instinct to
swallow everything up! Let's do it, Django! Strike it on the head! I'll relay
the Sun's rays from here above the ground!" Taiyoh!

Django, maybe you could help me find ShadeMan? If I can find him, I should be
able to figure a way home, back to Lan."

On the shelf along the wall in front of the counter, you'll find the Book of
Memories that contains records of all kinds of adventures. On the shelves to
the left and right, there is a book about investigations in San Miguel and
another about titles. If you read them, you're sure to get some new clues
for your adventure."

sharp, Solar Boy Django..."

MegaMan: "ShadeMan!"

ShadeMan: "Well, well! I wondered who it was... Who'd have though you'd follow
me all this way! I may have been defeated by you pests before, but soon I will
gain the true power of Darkness from this Doomsday world! And then... He he he
hee!"

MegaMan: "We're not going to let you get away with this!"

ShadeMan: "He he! You never change! I respect that determination of yours, you
know. So I'll give you a hint. The key to opening that door... lies with my
underlings... the four ShadeBats. They're gathering the power of Darkness for
me in the four corners of San Miguel. I wonder if you can manage to find them?!
He he hee!"

MegaMan: "Django! We must find those four ShadeBats fast! But what could he
have meant by the four corners if the city? Have any ideas?"

[Talk to Sabata]

Sabata: "What are you up to? Get a move on and delete that ShadeMan program,
now! In the meantime, you can leave Jormungandr to me!"

people. You two are just like him... Why am I always surrounded by such
fools...?!"

MegaMan: "Are you... Master Otenko?!"

<Screen fades>

Master Otenko: "Ah, that's right... Django, you must work with MegaMan to put a
stop to ShadeMan's evil ambitions. Sabata and I will keep an eye on
Jormungandr. It's quiet at the moment, but we mustn't let our guard down."

MegaMan: "Thank you, Master Otenko!"

[Talk to Master Otenko again]

Master Otenko: "MegaMan, the worlds we live in are different, but together we
must fight the Darkness. Tell us any time if you ever need anything. We're
always here to help!"

[Talk to Master Otenko again]

Master Otenko: "ShadeMan... A Darkloid, a man-made program that employs the
power of darkness. But how could it be here in this doomsday world... And how
can a program with no physical form function in our world? ...There's something
behind all of this..."

MegaMan: "Now you've got two clusters of Key Data! There are another two left
to find. Good luck, Django!"

[Destroy third Shadebat]

MegaMan: "That makes 3! Now there's just one more cluster of data to find.
Almost there, Django!"

told us about the key like that? It could be a trap... We must be careful,
Django!"

[At the top of Spiral Tower]

ShadeMan: "Hee hee hee. I've been waiting for you, Solar Boy."

MegaMan: "ShadeMan! You can't get away now! You must return quietly to our
world!"

ShadeMan: "He he hee... Of course I'll return. Thanks to that man, my ambitions
in this world have now been fulfilled!"

Django: ?

MegaMan: "What do you mean?"

ShadeMan: "You don't know? He he he he he! Even in this Doomsday world, you're
just a NetNavi in a PET. But I... Yes... thanks to Dark Matter, I have gained
physical form!"

MegaMan: "That's impossible...!!"

ShadeMan: "He he hee... First I'll have myself a nice snack... My first meal in
the real world... You'll do just fine, Solar Boy Django! He he heeeee!!!"

MegaMan: "Django! ShadeMan is shielded by the power of Darkness. First break
down his defense using the very same power!"

[After breaking ShadeMan's barrier]

ShadeMan: "You!! How did you...? Solar Boy using the power of darkness...?!
Even with no defenses, the power of darkness, Dark Matter, still dominates!
You'll soon regret getting on my wrong side!"

disappear... ...in THIS world! And again... back... ...to the... ...the
Cyberworld...!"

MegaMan: "Right, I'll be going then. I should be able to get back to the
Cyberworld using the Warphole ShadeMan made. I'm a bit worried about what's
become of him now though..."

Django: "Don't worry about it! It doesn't matter how many times he springs to
life... We're all here in this world and you and Lan are there in your world to
stop him. He doesn't stand a chance!"

someplace!!"

Solarsmith Things                                                        [SSMI]
===============================================================================

[Do a really bad job]

Smith: "Tsh... Not great, eh. Looks like your timing was great <number>
times(s), good <number> time(s), and bad <number> time(s). The key to forging
is temperature control and the timing of the strikes. You'll get better at it
the more things you make."

[Do a decent job]

Smith: "Oooh... A fine job! Looks like your timing was great <number> times(s),
good <number> time(s), and bad <number> time(s). Make sure you get some use out
of that, eh?"

[Do a fabulous job]

Smith: "Wow... Superb workmanship! Looks like your timing was great <number>
times(s), good <number> time(s), and bad <number> time(s). Great work, Django!"

[Make a rare weapon]

Smith: "Well... that's a pretty rare weapon! Looks like your timing was great
<number> times(s), good <number> time(s), and bad <number> time(s). This weapon
is R-rank, so it's got some hidden higher powers."

[Getting Smith's photo]

Smith: "Wow... Superb workmanship! Your timing when you're forgin' is perfect!
I can't believe you got it just right <number> times! I'm giving you this to
mark the occasion!"

[Talk to Smith with the Star Piece]

Smith: "Django, what do you have there... It's meteoric iron, a Star Piece,
right? Meteoric Iron comes from Star Pieces that have fallen from space. It's a
type of metal we could never make here on Earth. You could use it to make some
really unique weapons. But there's only enough of it to make one. Django, which
type will it be?"

<Choose "Spear", "Hammer" or "Sword">

Smith: "All done! You can't use that weapon for forgin', but it's already got
some special effects anyway. The first one means that, when you make an
Enchantment Attack, you can use solar energy directly from a Solar Station
instead of your own. Another special effect is that its power will adjust to
match your level. Success or failure depends on you with this weapon. Use it
well, okay?"

[Talk to Smith with one or more weapon level at 50]

Smith: "Django, looks like you've become quite skilled with weapons now. 
Okay... It's time we did some limit lifting for your SOLARSMITH so that you can 
make an S-rank weapon. But you can only lift the limit on one type, see."

Smith: "How about limit liftin' sword-type weapons?"

*<Choose "Sure">
*
*<Django recieves the Spade Emblem>
*
*Smith: "S-rank refers to weapons of level 49 or more. They each possess secret 
*special powers. You can make yourself a super weapon!"

*<Choose "No">
*
*Smith: "How about limit liftin' spear-type weapons?"
*
*<Choose "Sure">
*
*<Django recieves the Diamond Emblem>

<Choose "No" again and the questions will cycle round>

*[If only the sword weapon level is at 50]
*
*Smith: "Looks like you're best with sword-type weapons. "Okay then. Here's 
*proof of your limit liftin' for sword-type weapons, the Spade Emblem."

Boss Tips                                                                [BOTI]
===============================================================================

If poor Django fails to beat an Immortal, you can choose to continue and the
game will give you a helpful hint.

[White Duneyrr]

You can't attack Duneyrr when she's in the sky. You have to set the candle
stands alight to lure her down to the ground first.

There are two ways to light the candle stands. You can hit them directly by
hitting them with an Enchanted Flame weapon or you can activate the 4 lever
switches to set them alight.

[Vampire]

You won't get anywhere trying to attack a Vampire from the front. Stop the
Vampire from moving by sealing him with Sabata's Black Hole.

Defend Sabata and complete the Black Hole. Deflect attacks on Sabata to
yourself to make sure he doesn't get hurt, and be sure to take out any Vampire
Swords that are directed towards him.

[Red Durathror]

If a fake bud appears, keep an eye on its movement and hunt out Durathror.
Using CHANGE BAT will allow you to see right inside the bud.

If you follow Durathror, bite with CHANGE WOLF, and you can steal Life from
her.

[Blue Dvalinn]

Dvalinn's weak point is her head. You can inflict damage by attacking her arms
too, but don't get too engrossed in that and miss a chance to deliver a bit in
her head.

Dvalinn's Dark Breath and Ink Balls are Dark properties. If you transform into
Black Django, you can limit the damage you incur.

[Black Dainn]

Dainn's Dark Blast attack will plunge an entire area into darkness. But it's
possible to weaken his powers if you have the sun's rays to help you.

If you get caught in Dainn's grabbing attack, Shadow Arm, you'll incur damage
and lose Life, and Dainn's Dark Gauge will be restored too. Refrain from
attacking, but when the dark lightens, be sure to counterattack.

[Jormungandr]

When Jormungandr is protected by the power of Darkness, you can't hurt it. Get
rid of the Dark Guard by bathing in the Sun's rays.

Jormungandr's weak point is its tongue. Attack both of its eyes to get it to
open its mouth.

[ShadeMan]

It's difficult to dodge ShadeMan's WingStorm, an attack in which he summons a
large amount of Bats. But if you defeat the Bats when he uses a normal RedWing
attack, you'll be able to reduce the number of Bats that come during the
WingStorm attack.

After a WingStorm attack, ShadeMan lets down his guard down for a while. Don't
miss this opportunity to attack.
